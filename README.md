# AutoValue - Car Price Predictor

An AI-powered web application that predicts the price of a car based on user input such as fuel type, car body, engine size, and more. It uses a *machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)* trained on real-world car data, and a responsive *Flask + HTML interface* to deliver real-time price predictions.
The frontend (HTML) and backend (Flask API) were built using the help of an *AI tool to speed up development*.

## Dataset Source

This project uses the *Car Price Prediction* dataset from Kaggle:
- Dataset: [Car Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)
- Description: The dataset contains car specifications including car name, engine details, fuel type, body style, and actual price.

We used this dataset to *train a Random Forest Regressor model* for price prediction.

## Project Background

This project began with an initial script named car_prediction.py, where:

- The dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) was loaded and explored
- A *Random Forest Regressor* was trained using features like:
  - Car Name
  - Fuel Type
  - Car Body
  - Engine Size
  - Stroke
  - Horsepower
- *Label encoding* was used to convert categorical values to numerical format
- The model was evaluated using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Predictions were made using *manual user input from the console*
- Basic EDA like heatmaps were created to check feature correlation

Later, the logic from car_prediction.py was modularized into task1.py to enable:

- Code reusability
- Integration with a Flask web app (app.py)
- Web-based input via index.html instead of terminal-based interaction

This evolution allowed the project to grow from a script to a fully functional *AI-powered car price prediction web app*.

## Project Workflow

1. Load and clean the Kaggle dataset
2. Encode categorical variables (CarName, fueltype, carbody) using LabelEncoder
3. Train a *Random Forest Regressor* model
4. Save the model and encoders as .pkl files using pickle
5. Build a *Flask backend* to:
   - Load the model
   - Accept input from users via a web form
   - Return predictions via JSON
6. Create a *responsive HTML UI* using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap Icons

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python 3*
- *Flask* (web framework)
- *Scikit-learn* (ML)
- *Pandas & NumPy* (data manipulation)
- *Tailwind CSS* (styling)
- *Bootstrap Icons*
- *JavaScript* (form validation & fetch API)
- *HTML5*

## How to Run the Project 

1. *Download the project files*
   - Make sure you have these files in one folder:
     - app.py
     - car_prediction.py
     - task1.py
     - model.pkl
     - encoders.pkl
     - CarPrice_Assignment.csv
     - requirements.txt
     - templates/index.html (inside a folder named templates)

2. *Install Python (if not already installed)*
   - Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. *Open the folder in Command Prompt or Terminal*
   - Use cd to go to the folder location. Example:
     bash
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\car-price-predictor
     

4. *Install required Python libraries*
   - Run this command to install all required packages:
     bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     

5. *Run the Flask application*
   - Start the app by running:
     bash
     python app.py
     

6. *Open the app in your browser*
   - Go to this URL:
     
     http://localhost:5000
     
   - Fill in car details and click “Predict Price” to see the estimated price.
